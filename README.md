# Python-Learning-journey-for-biologists
I'm currently learning Python to build skills in data analysis, bioinformatics, and automation.   This repository documents my progress — from beginner exercises to small projects and data experiment
## Course Overview

## What I’m Learning
### Module 1: Python Basics
- Understanding variables, data types, and operators  
- Writing simple scripts for basic calculations  
- Practicing input/output and string formatting  

### Module 2: Loops and Conditionals
- Using `for` and `while` loops to process DNA sequences  
- Conditional statements (`if`, `else`, `elif`)  
- Writing small programs that count nucleotides in DNA  

### Module 3: Functions and File Handling
- Writing custom functions for repetitive biological tasks  
- Opening and reading `.txt` or `.fasta` files  
- Extracting and analyzing DNA or protein data  

### Module 4: Working with Biological Data
- Handling DNA/RNA strings in Python  
- Calculating GC content, transcription, and translation  
- Cleaning and visualizing simple datasets
